## Introduction

A Digital Stopwatch is an electronic device designed to measure time intervals with high precision. Unlike mechanical stopwatches, it uses digital components to provide an accurate time display. This project aims to build a stopwatch capable of measuring time up to 99 seconds with start, stop, and reset functionalities. The stopwatch relies on binary counters, flip-flops, and seven-segment displays, driven by a clock pulse generator.

Key features include:

- High-precision timekeeping up to 99 seconds.
- Start, Stop, and Reset controls.
- Display using seven-segment digital displays.

## Working Principle

The Digital Stopwatch operates based on the principles of binary counting and clock pulse generation:

- **Binary Counting:** The binary counters increment the count with each clock pulse.
- **Display Conversion:** A BCD to 7-segment decoder drives the displays, converting binary counts into human-readable time.
- **Control Functions:** Push-button switches enable the start, stop, and reset functionalities.
- **Clock Signal:** A 555 Timer IC generates a consistent clock pulse to drive the counters, ensuring accurate timekeeping.
